//You have recently seen a motivational sports movie and want to start exercising regularly. Your coach tells you that it is important to get up early in the morning to exercise. She sets up a schedule for you:
On weekdays (Monday - Friday), you have to get up at 5:00. On weekends (Saturday & Sunday), you can wake up at 6:00. However, if you are on vacation, then you can get up at 7:00 on weekdays and 9:00 on weekends.
Write a program to print the time you should get up.
Input Format
Input containing an integer and a boolean value.
The integer tells you the day it is (1-Sunday, 2-Monday, 3-Tuesday, 4-Wednesday, 5-Thursday, 6-Friday, 7-Saturday). The boolean is true if you are on vacation and false if youâ€™re not on vacation.
You have to print the time you should get up.//

//Write a program that takes as parameter an integer n.
You have to print the number of zeros at the end of the factorial of n.
For example, 3! = 6. The number of zeros are 0. 5! = 120. The number of zeros at the end are 1.
Note: n! < 10^5//
